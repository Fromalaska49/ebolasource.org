			Ebola Outbreak
		</h1>
		<p>
			Ebola hemorrhagic fever was discovered in 1976 during its first two outbreaks in Africa. One was in Sudan, while the other was in Zaire in what is now Democratic Republic of the Congo. The two different strains of the virus broke out in 1976 and were appropriately named Ebola Sudan and Ebola Zaire and since then, three other strains of the virus have emerged: Tai Forest virus, Reston virus, and Bundibugyo virus. Each strain of ebola is highly infectious and lethal except for Reston which is asymptomatic in humans. According to the CDC, there are four levels of biosafety:

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Biosafety Level 1</b>
							Examples: non-pathogenic E. coli, canine hepatitis, cell cultures
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
						<b>Biosafety Level 2</b>
							Examples: Chlamydiae, hepatitis A, B, and C, influenza A, Lyme disease, Salmonella, mumps, measles, scrapie, MRSA, and VRSA
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Biosafety Level 3</b>
							Examples: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia psittaci, SARS coronavirus, Rift Valley fever virus, Rickettsia rickettsii, rabies virus, chikungunya, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Biosafety Level 4</b>
							Examples: Ebola virus, Marburg virus, smallpox Bolivian and Argentine hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

			It is considered necessary to treat ebola with Biosafety Level 4, the highest level of biosafety; it is in the same category as diseases such as smallpox and marburg, and it requires the utmost care while being handled.

			Ebola's previous largest outbreak was in 1976 when it infected 602 people and was responsible for the deaths of 431. The index patient of the current outbreak was a Guinean 2 year old who died on December 6th, 2013. Since then, nearly 10,000 people have been infected according to official numbers which are widely believed to be under-counting the actual number of cases. There aren't enough beds or hospitals in West Africa to care for all of the ebola patients. People there are being cared for in their homes or other locations, that is, if they haven't been shunned, others are dying in the streets.
