			Ebola Infection
		</h1>
		<p>
		Primarily, ebola is spread through bodily fluids. Some have compared ebola to HIV/AIDS for this reason, however ebola's symptoms are radically different from that of AIDS and it is this difference which significantly increases its contagiousness. Ebola's symptoms include profuse bleeding, breaking of the skin, projectile vomiting, and explosive diarrhea, which all can spread bodily fluids with ease. It is said that a single drop of an ebola patient's fluids may contain more than 100,000,000 virus particles. These qualities cause ebola to be easily spread, it is only due to ebola's lethality that it doesn't infect many people at once; an ebola patient may die before the virus has enough time to infect a new host and spread.

			There is some evidence that ebola can spread through the air, however the ease with which infection is spread through the air remains a hot point of debate.
