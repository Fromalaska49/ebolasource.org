			Ebola Treatment
		</h1>
		<p>
			There is no known cure for ebola. The only treatment that we know of is supportive care. An ebola patient may be given an IV to battle dehydration and provide nutrients, they may be cooled if their fever is to high, but there are only experimental drugs available.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most successful treatment is to collect blood serum from ebola survivors (which will contain ebola antibodies) and transfuse the serum to ebola patients. Kent Brantly has donated his blood several times to help save ebola patients in the US. Unfortunately, there are very few ebola survivors, and each of them have a personal limit as to what amount of blood they are willling to give or are physically able to give.
